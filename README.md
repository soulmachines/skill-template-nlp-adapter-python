## Local Development

Create and activate Python's virtual env, then install requirements

```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following to start your local development server

```
python manage.py run
```

### Debugging with VS Code

2. Click on **Run and Debug**
3. Select **Python: Local Debugging** as the configuration
4. Add your breakpoints
5. Click the **Play** button

## Common Endpoints

Test the app's endpoints using Postman:

- POST Init: [http://localhost:3000/init]()
- POST Session: [http://localhost:3000/session]()
- POST Execute: [http://localhost:3000/execute]()
- POST Delete: [http://localhost:3000/delete]()

## Serve for use with Studio

Localtunnel may be used to generate a public web address for your locally-running Skill, allowing DDNA Studio to connect to your Skill from a live Digital Person.

Generate a URL with a personalized subdomain using the following command, and then use this URL to configure the endpoints in your Skill Definition.

```
npx localtunnel --port 3000 --subdomain your-unique-id
```
